# Book-Search-Engine / MERN

## Description

This is a MERN application refactored from a fully functional Google Books API build with RESTful API, to be a GraphQL API build with Apollo Server. The original app was build using MERN stack, with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js / Express.js server and API.
Refactoring made to original application:

* Set up an Apollo Server to use GraphQL queries and mutations to fetch and modify data, replacing the existing RESTful API.
* Modified the existing authentication middleware so it works in the context of a GraphQLAPI.
* Created an Apollo Provider, so that requests can communicate with an Apollo Server.
* Deployed the application to Heroku.

## Installation

* Please clone GitHub repository
* `npm init`
* Invoke application using `npm install`.

## Usage

In order to start the server you should run `npm start`.  Then it will show application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000/. `

## Technologies Used


* Java Script
* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap
* MongoDB
